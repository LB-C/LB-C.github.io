        This page is designed give a fun little crash course on what rowing is like. It features a personality test in which you can find what percentage of each seat in the boat you are, as well as a page in which those seats will be explained. There is also a photo gallery so you can see some rowers in action! Hopefully this will clear up some basic questions about crew, but above all it is just a fun site so please do not take any of the results from the personality test too seriously. Crew is above all a sport that brings people together to push themselves physically as well as mentally. It should be fun!!!

      Crew is such an amazing sport, and one of the things this author loves most about it is the fact that there are so many kind people who row who are incredibly supportive of the communities they are a part of. One such opportunity which the crew team takes is participating in the Prouty and raising money to send to the Norris Cotton Cancer Center. For more information, please visit the link below. If you would like to make a donation, you could do that for a particular rower or make a general donation (If you would like to donate to the author, my name is Lyra Bornoldt-Collins) or you could even join our team and raise money with us and be active outside for a good cause.
